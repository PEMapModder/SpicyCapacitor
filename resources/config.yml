### for example, for this file, it is "config.yml"
### if you want to go outside but still relative to this folder, use ..
### folders will be automatically created if necessary.
## Absolute paths
### put the path of the file/folder directly after starting with "file://"
### if you are on Windows, it still has to be "file://" but after it both slashes and backslashes are allowed.
## Resource paths
### if your path is inside the plugin resources folder, put the path of the file/folder relative to
###     the plugin resources folder after a prefix of "res://". note that you are not supposed to save files there, but only read from.
## Zip and Phar paths
### put the absolute path of the archive after "zip://" or "phar://", and then a slash, and then the paths inside the archive.
## Other schemes
### such as TCP, HTTP, etc. Supported schemes can be found at http://hk1.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php
